{{< spoiler text="How to send back your profile?" >}}
Please download this file ([bio_template.md](/documents/bio_template.md)) and edit it according to the instruction in the file (they are invisible here on the website) in a text editor, such as NotePad, WordPad, VIM and send it back to as an .md file or .txt file. If you are not familiar with text editors, here is a [bio_template.docx](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/documents/bio_template.docx) or [bio_template.rtf](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/documents/bio_template.rtf) version.

- Add a profile photo (at least 600px wide, preferably not bigger than 3-4 megabytles). We will make publish this picture in black and white behind a circle mask. Make sure that the crop of your face is not too tight in a circle. To avoid different formats of portraits, they will be behind a circle mask, as on the [partners](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/#partners) page.

- If you want to add your company/organization, please fill out this form twice, and send us a corporate/organizational logo, too. If your logo is cropped very tight, then preferably place it on a larger white or transparent canvas in the middle. To avoid different shapes of logos, they will be behind a circle mask, as on the [partners](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/#partners) page.
