We want to build a network of Innovation Labs, connecting labs and businesses that bring these novel scientific and innovation results nearer to civil society actors, individual creators, and microenterprises in services. We bring data-, sustainability-, rights management innovation, and novel distribution models nearer to the grassroots level of creation. We want to transform scientific and technical development into business development available for small creative organizations without a data engineering/science function.

Creating connected sustainability reports has many advantages.
- [x] It shows consumers, donors, and buyers that the company cares for sustainable growth.
- [x] The organization can ask for grants related to increasing sustainability.
- [x] In the EU, the company will be eligible for cheaper green loans, green insurance, and green investments.
- [x] Large corporations, including music event donors, may require their supply chain to produce credible sustainability metrics.

There are some difficulties that we want to overcome in this project.

- [ ] Connected financial and sustainability reports are complex, they require plenty of data, and mandatory only for 'large' corporations. Just like small companies can make 'simplified tax returns' and 'simplified financial reports', we aim to create a less complex and cheap `simplified, connected financial and sustainability report`.
- [ ] Due to the high complexity, they take a long time to create and are costly: the European Commission estimates their total cost at €10,000.

We offer free, manual calculation in the first phase to ensure we define these simplifications well. To reduce the time needed to collect data about your purchases and sales, we will rely on a part of the "trial balance", because this is available in your accounting system (and can be exported by your accounting software.) The trial balance is an annual summary of the general ledger accounts. We need only the expenses and revenues accounts, and do not need assets, liabilities, gains and losses.
