- [x] We highly recommend using [Keybase](https://manual.dataobservatory.eu/collaboration-tools.html#keybase) (an open-source version of Slack) and `GitHub` for secure file sharing and task management, including tender documents.  

- [ ] In the tendering phase, this is only recommended; we have a simple kanban-like card system of things to do, things in process, help wanted and done to make sure we do not forget anything.  To access the project kanban board (which is private), you do not need to be able to work on Github, you only have to register an account (it is free) and give us that username. If you want to start to take benefit of GitHub's powerful collaboration features, here is [our introduction](https://manual.dataobservatory.eu/collaboration-tools.html#github) to get started.

- [ ] Instead of emails we prefer Keybase. In case we win the grant, we will make its use mandatory, but generally, we prefer to use this in the tendering phase. 

- [x] We need to present the key persons in our [Open Innovation Lab](https://reprex.nl/project/crea-innovlab-2023/) (DataInnoLab) project. We follow the successful earlier examples in Horizon Europe and Creative Europe, see how to send us back your institutional [profile](https://reprex.nl/faq/profile/), and at least one or two key person's profile.

- [x] Please let us know what you think about the [internship program](https://reprex.nl/crea/internships/) element in an email or on Keybase.

- [x] Give the `full name` and `e-mail address` you want to use on the ECAS tender portal with your organization. We will add you via the ECAS tender portal to the Proposal (ID: `SEP-210944562`, Project Acronym: `DataInnoLab`, Call: [CREA-CROSS-2023-INNOVLAB](https://culture.ec.europa.eu/calls/call-for-innovation-labs), Funding scheme: `CREA-PJG`.

- [x] You must have access to our secret Proposal which is a Google Document. Please give us feedback and agree on a 2-3 page action list with a budget that relates to your organization.

- [ ] After we agreed on the action list and the rough budget, you will get a checklist of the formalities.  

- [x] You must abide the [CONTRIBUTOR COVENANT CODE OF CONDUCT](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) pledging to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
