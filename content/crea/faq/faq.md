For each open collaboration partner, we add a key personâ€™s profile and institutional profile to our collaboration website(s), in this case, to the [CCSI Data Observatory](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/#partners) page, and in the case of ESG reporting, at the same time to the [Green Deal Data Observatory](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors) page.

- [x] In case the tender is not successful and we do not want to pursue collaboration, we will remove your profiles.

- [x] We add at least one key person's simplified biography with data usually required in the proposal. Do include your ORCiD ID and LinkedIn URL.

- [x] One institutional partner page, do add your company URL and any social media links you like.  

We highly recommend using Keybase (an open-source version of Slack) and GitHub for secure file sharing and task management, including tender documents.  In the tendering phase, this is only recommended; in the case of contracting, we will ask you to do this because these are the tools we use for project coordination and management.
