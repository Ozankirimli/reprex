## Expectations {#expectations}

üìà `Eagerness to learn`, and enduring monotony: trustworthy AI and data products must work very accurately. Initially, you will work with many spreadsheets (Google Spreadsheets or OpenOffice or Excel.) If spreadsheets are not your thing, this is not your thing.

üíö Desire to `make an impact` on showing new talent or heritage from The Hague and your citi(e)s of choice in music, film, video, or photography.

üá≥üá± `Native level Dutch` (with excellent writing skills) and independent working capability English. You need to localize written text in a way that native Dutch speaker musicians, filmmakers, photographers understand it, regardless if they live in the Netherlands, Belgium or elsewhere.

üåà  Read our [Contributors Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). You must make this [pledge](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) if you want to work with us.

üêù  We give an `advantage` to candidates who want to make their language minorities more visible, or who may want to work with us in the long term, or, who accidentally likes bees and pollinators. {{< spoiler text="Regional languages or long-term interest?" >}}
_This are not required to make an application, but we are particularly happy to give an opportunity to people who want to make their language minorities more visible, or who may want to work with us in the long term._
- Reading/writing a regional language like Frisian, Basque, Surinamese, or other non-official language of the European Union may be a plus. 
- Interest in web technologies, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Go, or data programming (R, Python, RDF, JSON-LD.)
- You accidentally have an interest in beehives, beekeeping, and generally making The Hague friendlier for pollinators. We are not joking: we will sometimes work together with [BeeSage](https://beesage.co/), a startup that makes beehives smarters.
